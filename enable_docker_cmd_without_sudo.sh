# which is automatically created during Dockerâ€™s installation process.
# If you want to avoid typing sudo whenever you run the docker command, add your username to the docker group

# to add currently logged in user to docker group
sudo usermod -aG docker ${USER}
su - ${USER}

# to add a different user with username=abc to the docker group
sudo usermod -aG docker abc
